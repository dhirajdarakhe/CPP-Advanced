// ---------------------------------------------------------
// std::async() allows you to run a function asynchronously
// and it returns a std::future to retrieve the result later.
//
// std::launch policies control HOW the function is run:
//
// 1. std::launch::async   â†’ runs in a NEW thread immediately
// 2. std::launch::deferredâ†’ runs ONLY when .get() or .wait() is called (synchronously, in same thread)
// 3. std::launch::async | std::launch::deferred â†’ implementation decides (default behavior)
//

    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
    {
        sum += i;
        std::cout << '.'; // progress indicator
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(300ms); // simulate work (0.3s per iteration)
    }
    return sum;
}

int main()
{
    using namespace std::chrono_literals;

    // Launch Operation(10) asynchronously with std::launch::async
    // â†’ forces it to run on a NEW thread immediately
    std::future<int> result = std::async(std::launch::async, Operation, 10);

    // Simulate main thread doing something else for 1 second
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(1s);
    std::cout << "main() thread continues execution...\n";

    // Always check if the future is valid before using it
    if (result.valid())

        timepoint += 1s;

        // Check status of the async task
        // wait_until(timepoint) waits until either:
        // - task finishes
        // - or timeout occurs
        auto status = result.wait_until(timepoint);

        // You can also use wait_for(duration) instead of wait_until(timepoint)

        switch (status)
        {
        case std::future_status::deferred:
            // Task was launched with std::launch::deferred â†’ not started yet
            std::cout << "Task is synchronous (deferred)\n";
            break;

        case std::future_status::ready:
            // Task has finished execution and result is ready
            std::cout << "Result is ready\n";
            break;

        case std::future_status::timeout:
            // Task is still running, not finished yet
            std::cout << "Task is still running\n";
            break;
        }

        // Finally, get the result (blocks until task is done if not ready)
        auto sum = result.get();
        std::cout << "Final sum = " << sum << std::endl;

/*
ðŸ”‘ Things to Remember:
	1.	Launch policies
	â€¢	async â†’ starts immediately on a new thread.
	â€¢	deferred â†’ runs only when .get() or .wait() is called.
	â€¢	default â†’ implementation may choose either.
	2.	Future states
	â€¢	future_status::ready â†’ result available.
	â€¢	future_status::timeout â†’ still running.
	â€¢	future_status::deferred â†’ hasnâ€™t run yet, waiting for .get()/.wait().
	3.	Best practices
	â€¢	Always check result.valid() before .get().
	â€¢	Use wait_until or wait_for if you donâ€™t want to block indefinitely.
	â€¢	.get() can be called only once.

ðŸ”¹ Real-world analogy:
    â€¢	std::launch::async = ordering food at a restaurant (it starts being prepared right away in the kitchen).
    â€¢	std::launch::deferred = cooking it yourself at home (you only start when you decide to eat).
    â€¢	std::launch::async | std::launch::deferred = ordering takeout (the restaurant may prepare it immediately or wait until you arrive).
